# Project "Van Gogh"

Project Van Gogh aims to be a mathematical animation engine for creating generative art 
and graphics. 

This project is entirely meant to be an educational program, therefore the code isn't 
written for efficiency but for readability and consistency. The reason why I started this 
project is because I wanted to have more experience in open source software and programming
in the C language. I don't have a consistent product vision and my idea for this project 
is very vague. But the goal for now is creating a mathmatical animation engine and learning 
how to program an graphics card using the OpenGL API. I do accept merge requests and ideas 
from other people so if you are searching for a project to work on or improve your skills
then I greatly appreciate your help.
